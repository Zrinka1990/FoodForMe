        <div class="food-about">
           Since the early 21st century, the dried fruit has been marketed in the
           Western world as a health food, amidst scientifically unsupported
           claims regarding such benefits. In the wake of those claims, dried and
           fresh goji berries were included in many snack foods and food
           supplements, such as granola bars, yogurt, tea blends, fruit juices
           and juice concentrates, whole fruit purées, and dried pulp flour.

           Dried chia seeds contain 6% water, 42% carbohydrates, 16% protein, and
           31% fat. In a 100-gram amount, chia seeds are a rich source (20% or
           more of the Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamins, thiamin and niacin
           (54% and 59% DV, respectively), and a moderate source of riboflavin
           (14% DV) and folate (12% DV). Several dietary minerals are in rich
           content, including calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus,
           and zinc (all more than 20% DV; see table).The fatty acids of chia seed
           oil are mainly unsaturated, with linoleic acid (17–26% of total fat)
           and linolenic acid (50–57%) as the major fats.

            Blueberries consist of 14% carbohydrates, 0.7% protein, 0.3% fat and
            84% water. They contain only negligible amounts of
            micronutrients, with moderate levels (relative to respective Daily
            Values) (DV) of the essential dietary mineral manganese, vitamin C,
            vitamin K and dietary fiber. Generally, nutrient contents
            of blueberries are a low percentage of the DV. One serving
            provides a relatively low caloric value of 57 kcal per 100 g serving
            and glycemic load score of 6 out of 100 per day.

            The energy value per 100 g (3.5 oz) serving of the common mango is
            250 kJ (60 kcal), and that of the apple mango is slightly higher
            (330 kJ (79 kcal) per 100 g). Fresh mango contains a variety of
            nutrients (right table), but only vitamin C and folate are in
            significant amounts of the Daily Value as 44% and 11%, respectively.
            Numerous phytochemicals are present in mango peel and pulp, such as
            the triterpene, lupeol which is under basic research for its potential
            Mango peel pigments under study include carotenoids, such as the

          One serving (100 g; see Table) of strawberries contains approximately 33
          kilocalories, is an excellent source of vitamin C, a good source of
          manganese, and provides several other vitamins and dietary minerals in
          lesser amounts. Strawberries contain a modest amount of essential
          unsaturated fatty acids in the achene (seed) oil. Garden strawberries
          contain the dimeric ellagitannin agrimoniin which is an isomer of
          sanguiin H-6. Other polyphenols present include flavonoids, such as
          anthocyanins, flavanols, flavonols and phenolic acids, such as
          hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid. Strawberries contain
          fisetin and possess higher levels of this flavonoid than other fruits.

       <div class="food-about">
         Brown rice and white rice have similar amounts of calories and
         carbohydrates. Brown rice is a whole grain and a good source of
         magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, thiamine, niacin, vitamin B6, and
         manganese, and is high in fiber. White rice, unlike brown rice, has the
         bran and germ removed, and therefore has different nutritional content.
         Several vitamins and dietary minerals are lost in this removal and the
         subsequent polishing process. Among these are: oil in the bran, which is
         removed along with the bran layer, dietary fiber, small amounts of fatty
         acids, and magnesium. A part of these missing nutrients, such as vitamins
         B1 and B3, and iron, are sometimes added back into the white rice.

      <div class="food-about">
        Oats are generally considered healthful due to their rich content of
        several essential nutrients. In a 100 gram serving, oats provide
        389 kilocalories (1,630 kJ) and are an excellent source (20% or more of
        the Daily Value, DV) of protein (34% DV), dietary fiber (44% DV), several
        B vitamins and numerous dietary minerals, especially manganese (233% DV).
        Oats are 66% carbohydrates, including 11% dietary fiber and 4%
        beta-glucans, 7% fat and 17% protein.
        The established property of their cholesterol-lowering effects has led to
        acceptance of oats as a health food.

        Almonds are 4% water, 22% carbohydrates, 21% protein, and 50% fat. In a
        100 gram reference amount, almonds supply 579 calories. The almond is a
        nutritionally dense food, providing a rich source (20% or more of the
        Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamins riboflavin and niacin, vitamin E, and
        the essential minerals calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese,
        phosphorus, and zinc. Almonds are a moderate source (10–19% DV) of the B
        vitamins thiamine, vitamin B6, and folate, choline, and the essential
        mineral potassium. They also contain substantial dietary fiber, the
        monounsaturated fat, oleic acid, and the polyunsaturated fat, linoleic
        acid. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds are a source of phytosterols such
        as beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, sitostanol, and campestanol.
